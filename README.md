# passport-github

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [GitHub](https://github.com/)
using the OAuth 2.0 API.

## NOTE:

This is a local copy, made for Federated Wiki use, to fix an OAuth2 issue that surfaces in Passport. Do not use this repository from elsewhere as it is likely to disappear when, or if, there is a fix to the original package or we move to using something else.
